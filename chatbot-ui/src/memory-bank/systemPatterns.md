# System Patterns

**Architecture:**

*   **Component-based architecture**: The application is built using Vue 3 components.
*   **Single-page application (SPA)**: The application is a single-page application, with navigation handled by Vue Router.

**Key Technical Decisions:**

*   **Vue 3**: Used for building the user interface.
*   **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and code maintainability.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the components.
*   **Axios**: Used for making API calls.
*   **Vue Router**: Used for navigation.

**Design Patterns:**

*   **Component Composition**: The application is built by composing smaller, reusable components.
